**⚡ Ready to Use - No Configuration Needed!**

**Step 1: Prepare Your Google Sheet**

Create a Google Sheet with this exact structure:

|----|------------------|--------------|-----|----------|
| 1 | utilize | use | Action | phrase_bot_common |
| 2 | in order to | to | Objective | phrase_bot_common |
| 3 | at this point in time | now / currently | Time | phrase_bot_common |
| 4 | due to the fact that | because / since | Reason | phrase_bot_common |

**Column Details:**
- **Column B** (`robotic_phrasing`): Formal phrase to replace
- **Column C** (`natural_tone`): Natural alternative(s) - use `/` to separate multiple options
- Other columns (A, D, E): Optional metadata

**📋 Example Sheet Template:** [View Sample](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tYYH6jheUyyGtbPewPpGlptTZR-zW0zU-R9Opak5qHI/edit)
